                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages. It
                allows developers to organize content using predefined tags and attributes. Tags like are essential building blocks of an HTML document. HTML is responsible for defining
                elements such as text, images, links, forms, and multimedia on a web page. It is a static
                language, meaning it focuses on content structure rather than dynamic functionality. HTML
                files are saved with a .html or .htm extension and can be viewed in any web browser. As the
                foundation of web development, it ensures that content is properly structured and
                accessible, laying the groundwork for styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript.

                CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 3) is the latest version of CSS, designed to enhance the styling and
                layout capabilities of web development. It introduced several advanced features, including media queries
                for responsive designs, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes seamlessly. CSS3 also
                brought powerful tools like transitions, animations, and keyframes, enabling smooth visual effects
                without relying on JavaScript. New layout models, such as Flexbox and Grid, have simplified the process
                of creating responsive and flexible designs.
